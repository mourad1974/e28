lecture, lectures and lectures

## Notes for instructor

- When I created filtered recipes pages I wanted to use API from github, but for some reason it's not taking the data from there and taking it from the local file but the non filtered recipes are taking data from my github API. Also when I comment out the data , the filtered pages still work

- In main page "all Recipes" i click on the product to see more details and ordr, but the filtered pages when I click i get a blank page
